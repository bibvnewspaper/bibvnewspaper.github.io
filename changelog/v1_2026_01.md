# Version `1.2026.01`
## Updates
This is the first version of the BASIS Independent Bellevue's On a Monthly BASIS website. Here are the main updates of what happened:
- Contributing and Collaborators: I got my personal account editing access to the repo
- Markdown Pages: The current website is just a markdown file of what this is.
- Experimentation: A couple of things I tried out on Figma provided some inspiration
- Style Brainstorm: Brainstorming of what styles to use (fonts: Inter, etc.)

## Contribution
I connected my personal account `conquerer-of-tourist` to the repository.
- Now, I'm able to commit changes and all that from my own terminal
- The whole repo is just cloned my Visual Studio Code
- Now we can let the website account just act as a host (and do nothing)

## Markdown
- Markdown is neat and effective.
- Using MDX might even make things better.

It supports code:
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    return 0;
}
```

It supports $\LaTeX$:
$$\text{Some Equation: } E = \dfrac{m \cdot c^2}{1}$$

And it can do a lot of other flexible things. We're looking forward to seeing what we can experiment and do with this!
