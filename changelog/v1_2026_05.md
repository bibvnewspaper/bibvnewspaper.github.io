# Version `1.2026.05`
## Updates
This update refines the navigation bar styling for a softer, glassy look:
- Navigation: Rounded pill-shaped bar with a translucent glass effect
- Header: Added breathing room so the nav reads as a standalone element
- Scroll state: Slightly stronger glass and shadow on scroll

## Contribution
Improves visual polish while keeping the layout clean and editable.
