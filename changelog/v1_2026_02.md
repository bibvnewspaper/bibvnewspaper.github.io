# Version `1.2026.02`
## Outline of Updates
Now we added a bit more of interactive features, including the expansion of homepage and general text layout:
- Navigation Bar
- Program (coding) blocks and integration of equations and images
- (Next Steps: Create embedding for other media such as audio)
- Script is added with Javascript
- Now we incorporate more organized structure.

## Contribution and Organization
* These changes to the structure and content for the homepage, assets are updated.
* We have now added a more maintainable web structure for future additions
* Markdown Features (coded using HTML) include:
    * Homepage now demonstrating the usage of headers, paragraph, embedding, etc.

## Equation Rendering
* This update also added equation rendering via LaTeX
    * It is compiled with MathJax and the configured with TeX, etcetera

## Aesthetics
Refining:
* Navigation bar has a more soft and glassy look (very aesthetic); sticky-postition, stays @ top
* We add rounded corners which, of course, are always necessary.
* The visual layout is arguably (and objectively) more appealing. It's facts.
