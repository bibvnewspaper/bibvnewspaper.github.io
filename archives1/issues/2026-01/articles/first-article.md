# PreComps Exams
*By Hengsheng Wang*

The Pre-Comprehensive exams are approaching. Here are some study tips:

## Studying Habits You Should Try
1. Listen to music! Putting on your headphones and listening to the music you like, regardless of genre, is a good way to block out outside noise and put *yourself* in the zone! If you are like Hengsheng, you might want to listen to a lot of Jay Chou!

> Remember that you have put a ton of effort into studying for this exam. You're going to do great, but remember that regardless of what scores you get and how it impacts your grade, a test will never define who you are. You all are highly capable people (of course). Good luck!
