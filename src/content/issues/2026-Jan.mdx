## Hengsheng's Note
For contributing and developing
- As of writing the code for this issue, compiling and adding MDX became much easier.
- I'm stil working on adding a Mobile version for this wesbite
- In general, though vibe coding *does* go against my values, I think that is fine for frameworking.

Outside of that, I probably could have added more perspective for the anonymous article, as that seemed to cause a lot of community dissent amongst the greater powers of our society.
- Soon, the elementary comics will be available once I get my hands on the JPG files for the comics.
- That article is written by Danika Pierce, 10th Grade.
