Common Social Patterns We Observe, yet..
Refuse to Draw Attention to For Inexplicable Reasons

Have you ever been in that awkward situation when your parents are trying to get past a rule or make an absolutely unfair compromise in the educational system? It might be about getting a refund for the last three weeks of a course, even though you already took the first twenty classes. It might also be an argument with a teacher about a single point off on an assignment. It's a pretty abstract feeling, right? One might feel the ethical implications that your parents are trying to make the situation better for you, but you also feel guilty that your parents are purposefully trying to make a loophole past the rules. You might also feel that they are being excessively unreasonable, but it is too daunting to say anything about it out of the fear of being put down, and the humiliation you experience begins to surge in levels.

Here's another example. How about when you are on vacation in Taiwan and your parents and are attempting to engage in the tourism industry by buying magnets? It's 40 TWB for a single souvenir! It can be inferred that the man who's trying to sell the magnets probably doesn't make a ton of money every day, and 40 TWB is the American equivalent of just over a dollar. So the price is reasonable. Yet much to the disappointment of the seller, your parents are obsessed with saving money, and they try to negotiate the price to 30 TWB. The hypocrisy is sensed, and you don't end up buying anything; yet ten minutes later, an advertisement for an expensive authentic bubble tea pops up on a large screen, and the people with prominence in your group (your parents) immediately react with "Let's go buy that!"

The two last patterns I see a lot, whether with my parents or in a DiDi taxi in China, are that the middle traffic light does almost absolutely nothing and, as James Madison argues, "not all men are angels"; thus some people will opt for a greedy algorithm in traffic (and sometimes win). Taking a look at the first pattern, first picture a yellow light. You're about fifty meters away, and the yellow light just appeared. Now, you (and probably your parents) are thinking, can I get past that intersection before it turns red? Is there a red-light camera at the intersection? Obviously, when obtaining a driver's license, one knows that yellow means yield. However, in this specific scenario, it actually (based on my experience) prompts the driver to speed up and take a gamble at the law. The second thing I see a lot of is what I call "the traffic-jammed-single-lane-highway-exit" pattern. Picture this: there is a huge (jammed) queue on the side of the highway, full of cars trying to get into the exit. Now, your car is driving in the second lane, and wants to merge into the line.

Ideally, you would merge as soon as possible, because this is fair for the people who have waited in the line for very long. However, your driver might also decide to drive along at sixty miles per hour until they reach the exit itself, where they begin flashing their lights and force themselves into the line. In a sense, this is basically cheating, because if every car on the highway did that, people at the end of the line would probably never make it out of the highway. However, ignoring the feelings and emotions of other drivers, this is actually the best choice.

All of these examples are where we treat ourselves as the center of importance, and we can interpret these scenarios in two separate methods. First, if we always do what is optimal for ourselves, this can result in community dissent and anger. However, if we instead take the second point of view, it is crucial to realize that these actions are very unideal for everyone else we interact with. So, what choice is "correct"? Should you pay the 40 TWB for the magnet, or should you save speed across three miles of traffic, save twenty minutes of wait time, and leave the highway faster? That's some food for thought, something for you to ponder.
