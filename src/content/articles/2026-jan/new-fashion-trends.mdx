## New Fashion Trends on Campus

Written by Rebecca Guo (7Mn)

Lately a lot of different and notable fashion trends have popped up around campus:

1. For 2025, the accessory of choice wasn't hats or glasses, instead the kooky-monter faced plush. Many students can be seen with the character on their backpacks or bags. Labubus actually dates back to 2015, created by the artist Kasing Lung in a book called The Monster Trilogy. After partnering with the Pop Mart, Lisa from Kpop group Blackpink, and many celebrities such as Rihanna, Dua Lipa and Kim Kardashian have been spotted with the dolls in 2024. This attracted fans and eventually rose to fame through social media.

2. Uggs, the mid-height sheepskin boots, have dominated the shoe world. You could see Uggs almost anywhere, as the interior fleece makes it incredibly comfortable to wear. These boots were originally made by Australian surfer Brian Smith in the 1970s, and later made its way to America.

3. Baggy jeans have long been around, and many could be seen with this style. These jeans were popular in the 2000's, but gradually faded in favor of slim fit or skinny jeans. But in recent years, there's been a resurgence of baggy jeans, driven by nostalgia and streetwear influence. These pants are popular across generations, and represent comfort and expression.

These are only some fashion trends lately, but students are always finding new ways to express themselves, so whether you're keeping up with these fashion trends, or using unique ways to convey yourself, be creative about your look.
