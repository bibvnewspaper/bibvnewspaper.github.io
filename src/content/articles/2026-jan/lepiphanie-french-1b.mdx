## L'Epiphanie in French 1B

Written by TBD

This month, the French elective has celebrated the Christian holiday, L'Epiphanie, by eating the galette des rois (King's Cake). The celebration is usually held on the sixth of January, to celebrate the visit of the Three Wise Men. The cake is more like a pastry, being stuffed with marzipan (an almond and vanilla confection). A small figurine is hidden inside the galette des rois, and whoever gets it in their slice is the "king" or "queen" for the day, and has good fortune for the rest of the year.
