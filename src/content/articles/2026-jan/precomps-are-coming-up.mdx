## Stay Calm, Prep Early

By Stephanie Song

As precomps approaches, students start to develop strange and slightly embarrassing study habits and tips. Some of which work and others not so much. If you’re looking for any interesting ways to study or just wanting to spice up your studying life, here are some tips students swear by. 

1. You study better when you need to pee. Although it sounds silly, a full bladder causes a small stress response, which releases adrenaline and other focus hormones.

2. Listen to music on full blast (especially Jay Chou if you are like Hengsheng). Putting your favorite music on can improve your mood and block out noise if you’re studying in a loud environment. 

3. Film yourself explaining a concept in a podcast form
Similar to the Feynman technique, explaining a concept to somebody else or to a camera forces you to think about the idea differently and reveals gaps in your knowledge..

4. Lock yourself in a room and remove anything that could distract you. Removing everything distracting will make you focus on the task that you’re doing and will help you reach a flow state for a quick and effective study session.

5. Have your parents drop you off at a cafe with your phone at 10% (enough for you to call them if there’s an emergency) and all the study materials you need. Tell them to pick you up at a preset time and study till they pick you up.

Remember, strange or unusual things are what your brain remembers the most, so make sure to spice up your studying and maybe give these a try!
 
## Anonymous Confessions

Along with memorization tricks, students at BASIS Independent Bellevue are developing curious habits with the arrival of Pre-Comp season, raising questions about whether they truly help students succeed or instead add unnecessary stress. For starters, people have used listening to podcasts while sleeping to help them on tests. While this may seem like a great idea, getting enough sleep is key to doing well on an exam. Another example is chugging red bulls to stay energized while studying. However, be sure not to drink too much, as it can lead to caffeine crashes! Ultimately, rather than relying on strange and/or concerning study habits, students should use healthy study plans that support learning and exam performance.
