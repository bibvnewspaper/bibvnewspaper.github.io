## Focaccia Recipe

Written by Rahika Agrawal

Ingredients:

- 1 ¾ cups of warm water
- 2 teaspoons cane sugar
- 2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons sea salt
- 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- A sprinkle of rosemary and flaky sea salt for garnish

Instructions:

1. In the bowl of a stand mixer, fitted with a dough hook, combine the water and sugar. Add the yeast, and continue to stir it in. Set aside for 5 minutes, or until the yeast is foamy (if it doesn’t foam, discard everything and restart; the water may have been too warm)

2. Add the flour and salt, mixing on low speed until a shaggy dough forms. Then increase the speed to about medium for 5 minutes. The dough should look elastic and stick to the sides of the bowl

3. Get a large bowl and coat the sides with 2 tbsp of olive oil. Use a spatula to transfer the dough to the bowl with the olive oil (it’ll be too sticky to transfer by hand). If there’s any extra oil pooling on the sides, spread it on top of the dough

4. Cover the dough with a damp (not wet) towel, or plastic wrap, and set aside for 1 - 1 ½ hours, or until it has doubled in size

5. Brush a 9 x 13 in. baking pan with another 2 tbsp of olive oil (if your pan is nonstick, grease it with butter and then oil to prevent the dough from sticking to the pan), and also put some oil on your hands. Uncover the dough, and slide your hand under it and fold it in on itself; continue to do this until the dough resembles a ball that you can easily lift from the bowl

6. Transfer the dough into the prepared pan, and turn it over to coat the sides in the olive oil; press the dough into the sides of the pan, let it relax and pull away, then press into the sides of the pan again

7. Cover the pan with a damp towel or plastic wrap, and let it rest for about 45 minutes, or until the dough has doubled in size again

8. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit, and unwrap the dough. Spread the remaining 2 tbsp of olive oil on the surface of it, making indentations with your fingers (press into the dough from the top to the bottom of the pan), and sprinkle rosemary and salt on the top for garnish. Bake for 20 - 30 minutes, or until the focaccia is golden brown.
