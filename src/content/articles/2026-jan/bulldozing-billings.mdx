## Bulldozing Billings

Written by Vincent Hong (8Ti)

The Blackout Game turned our gym into a whole different environment in the best way possible. Slowly but surely, the stands started filling with avid spectators of our match against Billings, turning the annual Blackout Game into one of the most high-energy nights of the season.

From the beginning, our D1 team showed aggressiveness. Gavin Huang (8Pt) dropped two three-pointers in the first opening minutes, while Yan Xu (8Pt) set the overall pace by enacting plays. An initial momentum proved to be the reason why the atmosphere never let up: every clutch rebound and fast break brought a wave of encouragement from our side, whether it was through the consistent cheering or raucous clapping. It was clear that the players saw the intensity and excitement that comes with a packed gym.

As the game progressed into the end of the first half, Billings started to tighten their defense within the three-point line. Now, each possession turned into a small battle, with fouls occasionally appearing on the court. Even under pressure, the team continued to fight for control, with Linda mounting an unexpected steal, breaking through two defenders to make a tough finish under contact.

Rejuvenated with energy from the heat of the crowd, the D1 team rolled into the second half unscathed. Quick finishes, a contested three-pointer from Benjamin Jiang (8Pt), and an uncrackable defense led to our D1 players leading the game by more than 20 points. Throughout the second half, Vinnie Hong (8Ti) utilized Billing's weaknesses by getting four steals for his teammates to score. Furthermore, Arosh Swaroop (7Sc) riled the spectators with a long three-pointer, increasing the score gap even more. The second half saw the end of the Blackout Game, with the undefeated D1 Mountaineers winning against Billings in a final score of 52-29.
