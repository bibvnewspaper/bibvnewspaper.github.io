## Reeks of Rats | U.S. History

By Suri Song, Editor-in-Chief

In the past few weeks, the eighth graders have been wrapping up US History Unit 2 by learning about the Constitutional Convention, where delegates from 12 out of the 13 states met up in Philadelphia, not to “revise” the failing Articles of Confederation as many believed, but to synthesize a completely novel Constitution, or the Constitution we use today. To understand what the experience for these historical delegates were like, both 8th grade classes participated in their own convention, with each person acting out a chosen historical counterpart. Just like the real convention, tensions were high in US History, as each delegate along with each state had very different views on topics such as the branches of government, foreign affairs, slavery, and more. Let’s hear from some first hand accounts regarding the convention.

“I was Richard Basset from Delaware,” states Clara Jeon (8Ti), “being a delegate from a small state, I had to fight against the larger states for my rights and equal representation.” This was true to the real Convention, as the famous Virginia plan proposed for equal representation in both branches of the legislature, gaining the favor of many big states. Clara recalls that her highlight of the Convention was, “The proposition to make our Bill of Rights called the Bowl of Rice, and the president was addressed as 'The Handle’.” In the end, 8 Titanium voted to not ratify the Constitution. Yihan Li (8Ti) as Alexander Martin from North Carolina reflected that, “I did not ratify, because our constitution had a gradual abolishment of slavery, and as a southern state delegate I wanted slavery,” while Nathaniel Gorham of Massachusetts (Karace Ma) and Thomas Mifflin from Pennsylvania (Molly Miao), along with other Northern States voted to ratify. 

The class of 8 Platinum also voted not to ratify. From first hand experience as James Madison from Virginia, I (or my historical delegate) was a major player in the proposition of the Virginia Plan, and was very in favor of the Constitution. One of the most challenging aspects of the convention was getting the majority on board with virtually anything, as there were so many different opinions. The highlight for me personally was definitely the decision of making a coin toss, the deciding factor of judicial vs. federal conflict, and replacing the bald eagle with the turkey. The majority of students, including me, are willing to do the activity again, although it gets “kind of boring once you do it for 3 days straight.”
