### Brownie Ingredients

1. 10 tbsp unsalted butter
2. 4 oz chopped dark chocolate
3. ¾ cup light brown sugar
4. ½ cup granulated sugar
5. 2 large eggs
6. 1 tsp vanilla extract
7. ¾ cup all-purpose flour
¼ cup unsweetened dark cocoa powder
¼ tsp salt

### Peppermint Cream Ingredients

¼ cup unsalted room temperature butter
2 oz room temperature cream cheese
2 cups powdered sugar
1 tbsp milk
½ tsp peppermint extract
4-5 crushed candy canes


### Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and line an 8 x 8 in baking dish with parchment paper (make sure it covers everything inside)

2. In a microwave-safe bowl, put in the unsalted butter and dark chocolate, melting in 30-second intervals until smooth (every time you take it out of the microwave, whisk it before putting it back in); set aside

3. In another small bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, and salt; then set aside

4. In a large mixing bowl, put in the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and eggs; use either an electric mixer, stand mixer, or whisk it by hand until they are pale and frothy

5. Mix in the vanilla; while whisking, add the melted chocolate and butter mix until combined

6. Continue mixing, and add the flour mixture in but DO NOT OVERMIX as this will result in a dry brownie; just whisk until everything is combined and no more than that

7. Pour the batter into the prepared dish and place in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the top looks glossy and slightly puffed; DO NOT OVERBAKE since that will cause a cakey and dry brownie as well

8. To check for any raw batter, grab a toothpick/ skewer and poke the brownie; if it comes out dry/ with a few dry crumbs, it’s done; if it comes out wet with the batter, continue to bake
Once it’s baked, allow it to cool fully before spreading the peppermint buttercream on top; THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN MUST BE COMPLETELY COOL BEFORE ADDING THE CREAM or else the cream will melt and become messy

9. For the peppermint cream: use an electric mixer to cream together the butter and cream cheese

10. Once it’s smooth, mix in the powdered sugar 1 cup at a time; in between cups, add the milk and peppermint extract

Spread the buttercream evenly on the top of the baked brownie, then top with crushed candy canes; place it into the freezer to set for at least 30 minutes. Enjoy!
