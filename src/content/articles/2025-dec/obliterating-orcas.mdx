## Obliterating the Orcas

By Sam Liu

On Wednesday, December 10th, 2025, our Division Two basketball team had a great game against the new BASIS Independent Bothell team. Our Mountaineers won with a final score of 34 to 28. The game was exciting from start to finish, and both teams showed great effort and sportsmanship. The Bothell team was lead by our former Latin teacher, (the GOAT) Mr. Hui-Peterson. On the other hand, our Bellevue team was led by Coach DeMonnin, and many students, teachers, and faculty members filled the gym to cheer loudly for our team.

We all enjoyed watching the teams compete, and look forward to the next match against Bothell!

## Tis The Season For More Doors!

By Molly Miao

This month, the teachers here at BASIS Independent Bellevue have participated in a festive door decorating competition! When walking around campus, you may have noticed these brgihtly adorned doors, often featuring fun and colorful images. Several students have helped the teachers decorate for this event, such as Mia L. "I decorated Ms. Iliescu and Ms. PV's door during student hours. It was really fun, knowing that you were a part of the final decoration that everyone outside could see. I didn't do much, but I cut out the background for the door and taped it on with Ms. PV's help.

I guess in a way it was like the foundation for the whole thing," she remarked. The winners of this year's contest have alredy come out, namely Ms. Illiescu, Ms. PV, Ms. Xie, Ms. Zhang, and Ms. Chen.
