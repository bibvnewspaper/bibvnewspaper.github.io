## The Middle School Dance

Written by Vincent Hong

On Friday, December 5th, middle schoolers of BASIS Independent Bellevue participated in the Middle School Dance. As the lights turned off in the MPR, students were immersed in the “Let It Glow” theme. Here’s a personal account by one of the students attending the dance:

“The Middle School Dance was a Friday to be remembered,” writes 8th grader Vinnie Hong. “Lights were dimmed, but Christmas-themed headbands on partygoers illuminated the near darkness. There were many things that made the Middle School Dance special: slime-making, a DJ who took any song requests, and a variety of snacks. Grades split people into their own activities, with eighth-graders playing Mafia while seventh-graders performed their wildest moves on the dance floor. From the attire of students to the energetic DJ performance, the night was truly an experience of laughter, memories, and sometimes, awkwardness: Yikes! This event was not only a gift to the students, but also a reminder that nights can just be as wild and fun as the Middle School Dance. It was a night that replayed in our minds, showcasing how fantastic the event was.”
