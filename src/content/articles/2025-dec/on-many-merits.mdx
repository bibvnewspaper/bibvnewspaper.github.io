## On the many merits of Mr. Tyler

Written Anonymously

Mr. Tyler, in his fourth year at BIBV, is undoubtedly a monolith among our (most esteemed!) faculty, as well as a prolific and hugely popular (with varying degrees of popularity, depending on how many pages of notes he assigns on any given week) teacher. Therefore, I am proud to present Mr. Tyler’s BIBV career in review: The Highlights.

### Tie Tuesdays. 

Many keen observers of BIBV staff’s daily wear (and minute habits otherwise) will recall that, for a prolonged period of time some number of months ago, Mr. Norcross had taken to donning a spectacular pair of teal-hued trousers (convention for “pants” in the U.K., I hear. Can’t risk Americanization!) each Tuesday, leading to the short-lived and partially posthumous moniker of “Teal Tuesday.” 


Mr. Tyler, one of the myriad scrutinizers of Mr. Norcross’s legendary figure, noted immediately and with excitement this development. Recounting this phenomenon passionately to his students, Mr. Tyler told with hushed wonder how his students must not let their findings reach the ears of Mr. Norcross, lest any danger come to beloved Teal Tuesday. 

Alas, Teal Tuesday was not long for this world: soon after, BIBV students’ partially-fried pattern recognition systems were able to detect that, unfortunately, Mr. Norcross’s Tuesday trousers no longer bore any splash of teal. 

Not long were they to be disappointed, though. Mr. Tyler heroically took this loss as a sign to himself to take up the mantle of Tuesday visual entertainment. 

Thus, it came to be, that, every Tuesday, Mr. Tyler may be observed in his daily affairs about campus attired in what is often a Uniqlo-button down, dress pants, and a bizarrely-patterned tie (fan favorites include the Constitution and the Arizona Sun Devils. More bizarre patterns surely to come in the onslaught of holiday gifting). 

Furthermore, rarely Mr. Tyler will take it upon himself to perform an equally bizarre dance-movement sequence to attract attention to the unusual nature of the tie. As an early observer, I can perhaps best describe this dance as a cross between the mating dance of a particularly strange bird-of-paradise and a poorly-attempted crab walk, embellished with dramatic finger-pointing and -twisting, paired with a mildly indignant expression. (In an attempt to aid the bewildered reader, I will include a diagram. Please refer to Figure 1.)

Whether this can be taken as a sign of plagiarism in a bid to astonish, or simply the manifestation of the age-old phrase “imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,” is left to be seen. 

## Notes

It is unavoidable, at any given time, to attempt to walk along one of BIBV’s pseudo-hallways without hearing the moans and groans of whatever poor souls CollegeBoard has harvested this exam cycle, no doubt lamenting AP Classroom MCQ. 

Among these courses, Mr. Tyler himself has taken charge of the tutelage of A.P. Government, as well as A.P. US History. Among these two, former or current students may remember a rather generously-sized, hardback textbook with paper-thin sheets and indecipherable font size, weighing somewhere in the ballpark of five pounds. Each week or so, Mr. Tyler’s CJ entry will discreetly display a weeklong time period wherein two chapters or so of these textbooks’ reading material will be marked due, complete with an open-note reading quiz. 

Seasoned reading-quiztakers will note the variability in difficulty of these assessments. One week, the standard ten (or so) MCQ and two FRQ might seem straightforward. The next, the prompt might seemingly instruct the student to wax poetic on all they know of the U.S. government’s riveting fiscal policy, and fast (Mr. Tyler does not administer these quizzes at AP pace). 

Faced with such a dilemma, many students have taken it upon themselves to become innovators in the field of “Mr. Tyler’s Gov Notes” (known colloquially as such, across courses). Suggested and popular methods include:
 Completing the textbook readings in orderly fashion, spaced out regularly and in a reasonable amount each time, as Mr. Tyler suggests. 
 Anywhere from thirty to 70 pages, completed in the span of weeknight.
Some reports of entirely dashing the concept of notetaking for instead a desperate skim of the chapter. 
In addition, the APUSH textbook in particular has become somewhat known for its denseness and verbosity unlike any other. Mr. Tyler himself has noted the irony of starting a United States history textbook with the phrase “several billion years ago.” 

However, despite its notoriety, many would surely praise the contributions of these textbooks in earning their AP scores and high performance in Mr. Tyler’s classes. It can be concluded that, despite the weekly displeasure Mr. Tyler endures from student complaints, students would do well to complete their assigned readings anyways. 

## Looking Back...

All in all, Mr. Tyler is a beloved fixture of the BIBV community, and this article was written in a poor attempt at humor. 

To end, a quote from our Editor-in-Chief: “Michael Christopher Tyler is an evil old man.”
