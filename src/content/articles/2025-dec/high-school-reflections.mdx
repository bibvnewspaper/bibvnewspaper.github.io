## High School Reflections

The ninth graders have recently gained off-campus lunch priveleges, with the start of trimester two. Some of the ninth graders haven't been going off capus much or at all, while others have chosen to go very often. As of recently, the weather has been rainy and cold, which has affected how often students go off campus for lunch. As a ninth grader, Helena explains: "Although I have off-campus privileges, I have not gone due to [the] bad weather." Hopefully the weather will improve in good time, so that more of these students will be able to exercise their privileges.

Of the studnets that *do* go off campus, there is a wide range of the amount of times per week that they would go. Some students go off campus for lunch once a week, while others may go every single day. This depends upon the preferences and needs of each student. "Alexander goes every day because he doesn't have lunch," Alan V. from 9th Grade explained. Additionally, most ninth graders believe that the lunch period if plenty of time for them to get to places.

"It usually takes around fifteen minutes to walk there and back, so we have around thirty minutes to eat," Sophia, a 9th Grader, said. Some of the ninth garders have already picked out their favorite places to go off campus. "[We go to] QFC on Wednesday for the $6 sushi and Dick's Burgers," Alan shared. Some 9th Graders, whom haven't gone off campus for lunch yet, have already chosen places they wish to go. "I would love to go to Barnes and Noble to music album section," Helena shared. Overall, the students have a general view of the privilege as being positive.

Some students have even made memories, with the use of off-campus privileges. Alan shared that his favorite memory was when "Adam brought cake back to eat, and we ate half of it." Off campus lunch provides a nice break in the mdidle of their school day, before they return to their studies. "It's really fun. Best part of the day," Alan said.
