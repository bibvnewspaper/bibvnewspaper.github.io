          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            On A Monthly BASIS initially started writing issues back in the 2023 to 2024 school year, but it was then known as the "On A Weekly BASIS" newspaper. However, due to a cutback of roles the club, we are now reduced to one newsletter every month.
          </p>
          <p>The 2025-2026 year club is founded by Suri Song. Members of this club include Sam Liu, Stephanie Song, Rahika Agrawal, Clara Jeon, and Vincent Hong. Hengsheng Wang, the person who wrote everything you are currently reading, leads the development for the newspaper's website unofficially.</p>
